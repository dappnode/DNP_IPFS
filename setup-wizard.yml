      - **default-networking**: Restores default network settings.


      - **lowpower**: Reduces daemon overhead on the system. May affect node
        functionality - performance of content discovery and data fetching
        may be degraded.


      - **local-discovery**: Sets default values to fields affected by the server
        profile, enables discovery in local networks.


      - **server**: Disables local host discovery, recommended when
        running IPFS on machines with public IPv4 addresses.


      - **none**: Your node will use no routing system. You'll have to explicitly 
        connect to peers that have the content you're looking for.
        We recommend at least to [add a DAppNoder IPFS peer](http://my.dappnode/system/add-ipfs-peer/%2Fdns4%2Fipfs.dappnode.io%2Ftcp%2F4001%2Fipfs%2FQmfB6dT5zxUq1BXiXisgcZKYkvjywdDYBK5keRaqDKH633) 
        if you don't want to have problems getting DAppNode packages.


      - **custom**: Allows you to fine-tuning several parameters
