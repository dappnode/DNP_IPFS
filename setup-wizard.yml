      - **default-networking**: Restores default network settings.


      - **lowpower**: Reduces daemon overhead on the system. May affect node
        functionality - performance of content discovery and data fetching
        may be degraded.


      - **local-discovery**: Sets default values to fields affected by the server
        profile, enables discovery in local networks.


      - **server**: Disables local host discovery, recommended when
        running IPFS on machines with public IPv4 addresses.


      - **none**: Your node will use no routing system. You'll have to explicitly 
        connect to peers that have the content you're looking for.
        We recommend at least to [add a DAppNoder IPFS peer](http://my.dappnode/#/system/add-ipfs-peer/%2Fdns4%2Fipfs.dappnode.io%2Ftcp%2F4001%2Fipfs%2FQmfB6dT5zxUq1BXiXisgcZKYkvjywdDYBK5keRaqDKH633) 
        if you don't want to have problems getting DAppNode packages.

  - id: routing

      type: environment
      name: ROUTING
    title: Content routing mode
    description: >-
      There are two core routing options: "none" and "dht".


      - **dht**: Your node will use the IPFS DHT.
        When the DHT is enabled, it can operate in two modes: client and server.
        When routing type is set to dht, your node will start as a DHT client,
        and switch to a DHT server when and if it determines that it's reachable
        from the public internet (e.g., it's not behind a firewall).
        To force a specific DHT mode, client or server, set routing type to dhtclient
        or dhtserver respectively. Please do not set this to dhtserver unless you're
        sure your node is reachable from the public network.

        - **dhtserver**: In server mode, your node will query other peers for
          DHT records, and will respond to requests from other peers
          (both requests to store records and requests to retrieve records).

        - **dhtclient**: In client mode, your node will query the DHT as a client
          but will not respond to requests from other peers. This mode is less 
          resource intensive than server mode.

      - **none**: your node will use no routing system. You'll have to explicitly
        connect to peers that have the content you're looking for.

    title: Disable automatic NAT port forwarding
    description: >-
      When not disabled (default), go-ipfs asks NAT devices (e.g., routers),
      to open up an external port and forward it to the port go-ipfs is running on. 
      When this works (i.e., when your router supports NAT port forwarding), 
      it makes the local go-ipfs node accessible from the public internet.

    description: >-
      Sets the time between rounds of reproviding local content to the routing system.
      If unset, it defaults to 12 hours. If set to the value "0" it will disable content reproviding.


      Note: disabling content reproviding will result in other nodes on the network
      not being able to discover that you have the objects that you have. If you want 
      to have this disabled and keep the network aware of what you have, you must manually
      announce your content periodically.
